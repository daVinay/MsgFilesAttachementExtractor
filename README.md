Extract Attachments and their content From Msg Files

This programme was completed within few hours so it's not a pretty looking, full fledged professional project, it did however resolved my purpose of building it.

A quick built .NET framework project to extract the attachments from the .msg Outlook files.
Used MSGReader nuget package https://www.nuget.org/packages/MsgReader/

For my purpose I only needed it to work with local stored files, feel free to download the code and implement using IMAP/POP3 to get files from server.

I'm not attaching the whole build, package and property files as tech is always changing so might confuse the new coders out there.

To start:

-   Go to vs
-   create a new project and
-   paste the program.cs content
-   dont forget to include the packages
